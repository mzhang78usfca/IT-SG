\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.



% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
\graphicspath{{./image/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{float}

%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
In a news report\cite{economist}, Singapore was described as a new center of economy and IT industries after a faster recovery from Covid-19 pandemic than other Asia countries. This became the motivation of this project, where data were collected and visualized to see if they can successfully prove or disprove this assumption. There were three key objectives when collecting data:

1. Find out data that show how good Singapore’s Covid control was, compared with other countries.

2. Find out data that show how the labor market related to IT industries (or the overall labor market) behaves during Covid influence.

3. Find out data that show if large IT companies moved to Singapore during and after Covid-19 pandemic.

\section{Related Work}
There were multiple papers that guided the direction of research and data searching in this project. A couple of finished visualizations found online also inspired the designing of visualization in this project.

\subsection{Data Research}
As previously mentioned, the whole project was inspired by the report on economist.com\cite{economist}. On addition to that, overall research direction was inspired by some research papers studying on other Singapore industries like Shuqiong Wu’s research on AI industry\cite{ai} and Weihua Ji’s research on Singapore Innovation Center program\cite{innovation}.

In objective 1, data source and data-handling process were all inspired from the Covid-19 section of Our World in Data website\cite{ourworld}, where a detailed visualization about Covid-19 data in many countries was shown with helpful analyzing tools.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{1}
\caption{A deleted version of S pass versus work permit visualization, represented in a stacked bar chart.}
\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}


In objective 2, The data source and story-telling were inspired from a summary flier released by Singapore IMDA\cite{imda_flyer}, which contained a research of IT industry revenue improvement from 2013 to 2018. The labor market analysis was inspired by the early study done related to the same topic: how the labor market was affected by Covid Pandemic\cite{labor_market}.

\subsection{Data Visualization Research}
All visualizations in this project were built on d3v7\cite{d3}. The selection of visualization type was guided by Fundamentals of Data Visualization\cite{fundamentals}. Legends were created using D3 SVG Legend(V4)\cite{d3legend}, an external d3 library. Interactive tooltips were created following the Tooltip V7 guidance from d3noob\cite{d3noob}. The website design and style sheet was built using a template provided from HTML5-UP\cite{html5}.

\section{Approach}
\subsection{Approach on Data Collection}
In objective 1, the first approach was to collect data from each countries’ official data source. However this increased the data to find and difficulty due to language issues. In the end a combined data release from Johns Hopkins University\cite{ourworld} was used.

In objective 2, the labor market data was collected from work permit info released by the Singaporean Ministry of Manpower\cite{foreign_workforce}. GDP info was collected from The World Bank website\cite{world_bank}. InfoComm Industry Revenue data were collected from Singapore IMDA annual report\cite{imda_reports}.

In objective 3, the company data were manually collected by searching online for news relating to the company office opening in Singapore.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7.0in]{2}
\caption{The confirmed cases and death cases in Singapore, Australia, Italy and the US. Cases number are represented as per population and 7-days rolling average was used to minimize n\textbackslash a data and zero data caused by different data releasing formats in each country (e.g. some countries don’t release cases reported during the weekend until next business day).}
\label{fig:2}
\end{figure*}
\begin{figure*}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=7.0in]{3}
\caption{The confirmed/death case per capita versus vaccination rate in multiple countries around the world. The figure on the right has non-asia countries filtered out.}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Approach on Storytelling Implementation}
To finish storytelling, three web pages were built for each objective. By clicking the navigation link at the bottom of the page, the user can travel to the next/previous page. 

\subsection{Approach on Data Visualization}
In objective 1, Line charts and parallel coordinates were used to represent Covid data. 

In objective 2, a line chart was used to compare GDP with IT industry revenue. A grouped bar chart was used to compare S pass and work permit issued by the Singapore government.


This part was firstly finished in grouped bar chart, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, however as mentioned in Fundamentals of Data Visualization\cite{fundamentals}, stacked bar chart can lead to misunderstanding and confusion since stacked bar chart can either represent a diagram stack on the other, or a diagram laying in front of the other, resulting on different impression.

In objective 3, a bubble chart was used to show the size, moving date and company revenue for companies moved to Singapore.

\subsection{Approach on Interactivity Implementation}
On every line chart and parallel coordinates, users can click legend to filter data, as well as using tooltip to see the current data point mouse hovers on. On the company bubble chart, users can hover on any bubble to see company info and news that referenced the move of the company.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Covid-19 outcome}



As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:2}, the death number and case number (calculated using 7-days rolling average) was visualized in two line charts. By comparing covid case number and death number, the visualization showed that Singapore has relatively low death cases per population, even when confirmed cases per population is high. This means that health care, vaccination and treatment in Singapore did a very good job on controlling Covid cases becoming serious or causing death.



As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:3}, the case number and vaccination rate were visualized in a parallel coordinate. By comparing data from Singapore and other countries, the visualization shows that Singapore has a higher recovery rate and vaccination rate than not only other Asia countries, but also most of the other countries listed here. This showed that Singapore indeed had a better outcome dealing with Covid-19 Pandemic.

\subsection{IT industry growth}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{4}
\caption{The Work Permits given by the Singapore government versus the number of S passes. S passes are for mid (or above) level skilled workers and are more related to the IT industry compared with work permits.}
\label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:4}, the number of 2 different labor markets were compared in a grouped bar chart. It was shown that S passes didn’t decrease as dramatically as work permits during the Covid-19 pandemic, which means that high-tech related jobs didn’t drop through the pandemic, but didn’t increase as well, which is against the idea that Singapore was becoming the new center of IT industry in Asia (which means a huge transfer on labor market).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{5}
\caption{The GDP growth in Singapore versus the InfoComm Industry Revenue.}
\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:5}, the GDP growth in Singapore was compared with InfoComm Industry revenue in a line chart. From the visualization, the infoComm Industry had a drop in revenue at the beginning of Covid-19 Pandemic and haven’t been able to recover from it even when GDP showed a clear rebound.

\subsection{Companies}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{6}
\caption{The data of IT companies moved to Singapore through Covid Pandemic period. X axis shows the date of office moving, Y axis shows the company global revenue, bubble size shows the Singapore office size by Employee count.}
\label{fig:6}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:6}, some companies that moved to Singapore through Covid Pandemic period were gathered and their data was compared in a bubble chart. It can be analyzed from the chart that even though some big companies (Tencent, Dyson) moved to Singapore, the office size is not significantly larger than other smaller companies. This indicates that those offices act more like overseas offices instead of main offices.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because

%\end{figure*}

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Summary}

These three objectives showed that, although Singapore handled Covid Pandemic significantly better than other countries, the IT industry didn’t receive a huge increase due to it. And not too many large IT companies moved their main office to Singapore. Since the visualizations on objective 2 and 3 support each other very well, they can be regarded as convincing evidence.
Therefore, the assumption that Singapore has become the new IT center in Asia can be successfully disproved. The project is considered as successful.

\section{Discussion}

Overall, the bubble chart was the most promising approach of the project, since it allows users to compare company data in three dimensions. It was also directly related to the IT industry, which is not like the labor market approach, which might not have had enough relationship with the IT industry. After all, there were many industries other than the IT industry that required the Singapore government to give S pass. A better way to start a project would be to start from more research papers provided by Singaporean sources, which could lead to data that relate more closely to the Singapore IT industry labor market. The overall project provided a huge improvement on the author’s experience on data gathering and visualization designing.

\section{Future Work}

If there were more time for research, a survey sent to actual Singaporeans would be very helpful to further enhance the evidence of labor market change. More company info would make objective 3 more convincing so that is a point for improvement, too.
